        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
        Sunstone Consuling specialises in building enterprise web
        applications for businesses of all sizes.   
        </p>
        <p>
        These can range from simple database or stock management
        tools, to more complex cloud applications allowing
        collaboration between different departments or
        organisations.
        </p>
        <p>
        Web applications have the advantages of being
        cross-platform, requiring no installation, support or
        updates, and being accessible from a range of different
        devices and platforms, which allows for more flexible
        working.

            <h2>Tools that grow as you do</h2>
            <p>
                Our focus is on providing tools that fit with, or extend
                your existing working methods.  We place a lot of
                emphasis on discussing your needs and existing workflow,
                and working together to create an application that will
                prove effective to use and simple to implement.
            </p>
            <p>
            In addition, we aim to make tools that can scale and adapt,
            so that as your organisation grows, the tools we have built
            can grow to accommodate your changing needs.

            <h2>Case Study - ATQuote</h2>
            <p>
            <a href=www.atquote.co.uk>ATQuote</a> is an online quotation
            platform that was developed by Sunstone Consulting for
            equipment suppliers and assessment centres
            administering the <a
                href="https://www.gov.uk/disabled-students-allowances-dsas/overview">Disabled
                Student's Allowance.  </a> 
            </p>

            <p>
            It allows suppliers to create an inventory of
            available products, enabling assessment centres to
            quickly generate quotes for the equipment they wish to
            recommend.  
            </p>
            
            <p>
            Using ATQuote means that assessment centres
            don't have to request quotes individually from
            suppliers.  This speeds up their report writing, and
            the delivery of student support.  It also allows
            centre administration staff to view and edit quotes
            that their assessors create, which improves quality
            assurance and makes it easy to amend errors quickly
            before reports are sent out.  
            </p>

            <p>
            In addition, when quotes are sourced using the platform, it
            removes the need for suppliers to respond to individual quote
            requests, which reduces their workload in turn.
            </p>

            <p>
            ATQuote was approved by <a href=http://www.slc.co.uk/>The
            Student Loans Company</a> for use in
            the DSA sector in January 2015, and is now in use by over
            300 Study Needs Assessors across 54 Assessment Centres.
            </p>
